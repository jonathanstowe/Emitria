This isn't really needed for an internet radio station anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why Emitria?\r\n## ------------\r\n\r\nWell to be honest I couldn't think of a non-stupid name.  So I asked on Facebook.  The lovely Aaron Udy, a DJ, electronic music producer and radio host suggested it :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
