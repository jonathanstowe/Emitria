<p>Emitria is a software platform for the management of an internet radio station,  it is inspired by the excellent Airtime <a href="http://airtime.sourcefabric.org/">http://airtime.sourcefabric.org/</a>.</p>

<p>In summary it provides the means for managing a radio schedule, managing the media that is to be played on the station and causing that media to be streamed to the network.</p>

<p>Under the hood it relies on two tried and tested software applications for performing the streaming:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Icecast2 <a href="http://icecast.org">http://icecast.org</a> - the de facto standard for open source streaming servers with virtually universal client support</li>
<li>  Liquidsoap <a href="http://liquidsoap.fm/">http://liquidsoap.fm/</a> - a rock solid middleware for providing streams to an icecast server, managing multiple input streams (files, playlists live streams etc) and transcoding them as multiple format streams to the icecast server.</li>
</ul>

<p>The high level design goals for this application are:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Provide a higher degree of cross-platform compatibility (Airtime targets debian nicely, other Linux reasonably well, other OS not well at all.)</li>
<li>  Reduce the application complexity by using fewer different implementation technologies (this is written in Perl, whereas Airtime is in PHP and Python.)</li>
<li>  Allowing a greater degree of choice of database used for storage (Airtime exclusively uses PostgresSQL whereas this will use the Perl DBI allowing most supported databases to used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that the architecture will be fairly similar at a high level to Airtime:</p>

<ul>
<li>  A web part providing the management console and services for access to the schedule by 3rd party software</li>
<li>  A media management part to deal with incoming media files</li>
<li>  A playout engine to manage the scheduling of the playout and the control of the liquidsoap daemon.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>  Play in/Play out through hardware interfaces:  interfacing with hardware is very platform specific, the liquidsoap build may support alsa, jack or something else for a given platform but it is diificult to determine which interfaces may be available.  This isn't really needed for an internet radio station anyway.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well to be honest I couldn't think of a non-stupid name.  So I asked on Facebook.  The lovely Aaron Udy, a DJ, electronic music producer and radio host suggested it :)</p>
